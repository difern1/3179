<title>An Insight Into Global Emissions</title>

    <h1>An Insight Into Global Emissions</h1>
    <h2>By Dinal Fernando 32511051</h2>
    <p id="para1"> This visualisation explores the CO2 emissions of countries and regions in order to analyse the relative 
        largest producers of CO2 emissions as well as connections between CO2 producers and measures such as quality of life and prosperity. <br><br>
        This visualisation first examines a global map of the per capita emissions of each country, contexualising the impact of producers on a global scale. The visualisation then takes a more in depth look
        into exactly who the largest producers are and what the sources are of emissions by these countries. Finally, this visualisation will explore the impact that CO2 emissions have had on the
        livelihood and prosperity of countries. 
        <br><br>
        In doing so, this visualisation allows for an understanding as to the forms of emissions produced, and the necessity of CO2 emissions 
        for a nations prosperity which will potentially allow for a reduction in CO2 emissions globally. </p>
    
        <p id="para2"> The Global Per Capita Emissions </p>

    <div class="map-container"> <!-- Flex container -->
        <div id="choropleth_map"></div>
        <p id="para3">This choropleth map shows the Per capita emissions of countries. 
            Use the dropdown menu to centre the map on various regions, and use the zoom to further interact with the map. 
            As shown, Qatar has the highest per capita emissions with a population of 2.688 million.<br><br> Further, there is a far lower concentration of higher producing countries in Africa. In the 
            Americas, Canada and North America also feature relatively higher per capita emissions.
            </p>
    </div>

    <p id="para4"> How Emissions are Produced </p>
    <p id="para7"> The three visualisations below demonstrates the quantity and types of emissions produced by countries. The bar chart below shows the CO2 emissions of the top 8 countries. As seen 
        in the visualisation, China produces the highest amount of CO2 emissions. The red line shows the average emissions. The pie chart shows the composition of global CO2 emissions. Coal highly 
        dominates the production of CO2 globally. Finally, the grouped bar chart shows and compares the amount of Coal, Oil and Gas emissions produced by the top 5 producing countries.

<p id="para5"> How Emissions Effect Lives</p> 

<div class="bottom-charts-container">
    <div id="bubbleplot"></div>
    <p id="para6"> The bubble chart on the left and the scatter plot on the right show the effects in which CO2 emissions have had on various regions and nations. The bubble plot on the left 
        shows the correlation between GDP and the total emissions of countries, with size representing population. There is a clear correlation between GDP and emissions, wherein higher total emissions
        contribute to a higher GDP. This is likely due to manufacturing of exports boosting GDP. <br><br>On the right, the scatter plot demonstrates the connection between labor force participation and emissions
        in significant producing countries (per capita emissions > 2.5). There is a clear relationship between the two, with higher per capita emissions correlating to higher labour force participation.
        This can be contributed to a greater manifacturing industry providing more jobs for individuals.  </p>
